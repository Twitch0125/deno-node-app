# App Overview

1. Have a form at `/upload`
   1. handle a .tar.gz file upload from this form
   2. use basic-auth
2. extract and save the files in the .tar.gz
3. serve the extracted files
4. Be able to host on a server for free (or close to free)
5. Use Web Standard APIs whenever possible

# Deno <logos-deno class="text-2rem text-center" />
- Initial release: May 15 2018
- Written in Rust
- Web standards focused
- Robust std lib inspired by Golang's std lib
- First-class tooling, typescript, std library
- Browser-like packackge management <v-click> <small class="opacity-60 italic"> I'll explain later </small> </v-click>


<template #right>

# Node <logos-nodejs-icon class="text-2rem text-center" />
- Initial release: May 16, 2009
- Written in C/C++
- Node APIs but supports many Web Standards
- Minimal node:modules provided
- Some built in tooling (test runner)
- NPM
</template>

# The Deno App

## Uses the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework
A framework for the "Edge"

I did one in JS and HTM, and one with TS and JSX
- Typescript (and Javascript)
- Templates with JSX (and HTM)
- No build step

```ts
import { Hono } from 'https://deno.land/x/hono/mod.ts'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hono!'))
```

# Package Management in Deno
There's a couple ways of doing it

It's kinda weird

<!--
Deno's package management was kind of weird to get used to.
-->

---

 
# Deps.ts

<v-click>

Recommended for libraries since it can be overidden by an import_map

```ts
//deps.ts
export { ensureDir } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/fs/mod.ts'
export { readableStreamFromReader, readerFromReadableStream } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/streams/mod.ts'

//main.ts
import { ensureDir, readableSteamFromReader } from './deps.ts'
```

</v-click>

---


# import_map.json

<v-click>

The "final say" in what version of a package to use. Recommended for Apps.

```json
{
  "imports":{
    "https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/": "https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/",
    "fs": "https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/fs/mod.ts",
    "streams": "https://deno.land/std@0.190.0/streams/mod.ts",
    "templates/": "./templates/"
  },
  "scopes": {
    "https://deno.land/x/thingy/": {
      "https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/": "./patched/"
    }
  }
}
```
```js
import { ensureDir } from 'fs'
import { readableStreaFromReader } from 'streams'
import { UploadPage } from './templates/upload.js'
```

</v-click>

<!-- There's [jspm.io](https://jspm.org) which is a sort of package manager for import_maps, but its more meant for moving your package.json over to an import_map.
 It also has issues if you use "imports" like "./templates/" because its trying to install those paths -->

---

# package.json

<v-click>

Nice if you're migrating to Deno, but who does that?

Installs into a node_modules directory so you can run things with npm.

Only works with packages from npm.

Doesn't FULLY support package.json. You can only run "basic" commands, though I don't exactly know what that means. I could run UnoCSS soooooo...

```ts
//package.json
{
  "dependencies":{
    "hono": "latest"
  }
}

//app.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

```


</v-click>

# Packages are pulled at runtime
Like a browser!
 
As the browser parses the `<script>`s and `<link>`s it downloads them

As deno parses `import`s it downloads them [^1]

With Node you'd do that all ahead of time with `npm install`

[^1]: You can cache ahead of time with `deno cache`, but I've had issues with getting it to cache *everything*

<!-- It can be hard to specify every single file that might have a dependency. Fresh for example kept downloading some Preact related package at runtime.-->

---

# Serving static files

Deno made this easy. Here's the route that serves static files from the
`./extracted` directory

```ts
import { serveDir } from "https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts"; //Deno's std static file server

Deno.serve(req => serveDir(req, { fsRoot: Deno.cwd() + "/extracted/news/html", quiet: true }))
```

<!--
the `Deno` object is a global helper/namespace for Deno apis separate from the std library
Hono actually provides a helper for static files, but this works too.
-->

# HTML Rendering with JSX

<v-click>

JSX ðŸ¤¢

```tsx
import { BasePage } from "templates/base.tsx";
import { FileUpload } from "components/FileUpload.tsx";

export const UploadPage = (props: { message?: string } = {}) => (
  <BasePage>
    <form
      x-data="{file: null, loading: false}"
      action="/upload"
      method="POST"
      enctype="multipart/form-data"
      {...{ "@submit": "loading=true" }} /* WHYYYYY */
    >
    ...
    </form>
  </BasePage>
);
```

```ts
import { UploadPage } from "templates/upload.tsx";

app.get( "/upload" ,basicAuth({ username: "admin", password: Deno.env.get("AUTH_PASSWORD") }),
  (ctx) => {
    return ctx.html(render(UploadPage()));
  },
);

```
</v-click>


---
layout: center

# Don't forget to do this to get JSX to work

```jsonc
//deno.jsonc
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "preact"
  }
```
---

# Web Streams are the default in Deno. They're nice.
- You can pipe ReadableStreams to WritableStreams
- WritableStreams need to be closed
- You can read from StreamReaders
- You can write to StreamWriters
- TransformStreams have a StreamReader and StreamWriter to read and write

<v-clicks>

```js
const writableStream = new WritableStream()
const writer = writableStream.getWriter()
const readableStream = new ReadableStream()

const transformer = new TransformStream()

const reader = readableStream.pipeThrough(transformer).getReader()

for await (const chunk of reader.read()){
  writer.write(chunk)  
}
writer.close()

// await readableStream.pipeTo(writableStream)

```
</v-clicks>

---

# Using web streams

```js {1-2|3-7|8-12|13-35|all}
const fsFile = await Deno.create(Deno.cwd() + "/uploads/report.tar.gz");
await file.stream().pipeTo(fsFile.writable) //this writes the report.tar.gz file
//get a FsFile for our newly created file
const uploadedFile = await Deno.open(
  Deno.cwd() + "/uploads/report.tar.gz",
  { read: true },
);
await ensureDir(Deno.cwd() + "/extracted");
//uploadedFile.readable is a ReadableStream so we can pipe it to writable streams
const gzipReader = uploadedFile.readable.pipeThrough(
  new DecompressionStream("gzip"), //DecompressionStream is a TransformableStream
).getReader()
const untar = new Untar(readerFromStreamReader(gzipReader));
for await (const entry of untar) { //async iteration of untar
  if (entry.type === "file") {
    await ensureFile(`${Deno.cwd()}/extracted/${entry.fileName}`);
    const writer = await Deno.create(
      `${Deno.cwd()}/extracted/${entry.fileName}`,
    );
    await copy(entry, writer);
    writer.close();
  }
}
return ctx.html(render(UploadPage({ message: "Upload successful!" })));
```

# Deno frustrations

- Frequent breaking API changes
  - It felt like 50% of the Stack Overflow posts I read were outdated and were only a year or so old
- Deno.MODULE being moved to its own `std/` lib without any deprecation notice in the code
  - If you try to use a module it should say "hey this was moved to its own std library!"

# The Node App

## Uses the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework
A framework for the "Edge"

- Javascript
- Templates with [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm)
- No build step

# Subpath Imports

I discovered this while trying to find if Node supported something like importmaps. They fix having to figure out the relative import path of a module.

No more '../../../db/tables/something' paths!

<v-click>

Has to start with a '#'.

```json{1,4-10}
//package.json
{
  "dependencies": {...},
  "imports": {
    "#html": "./templates/html.js",
    "#templates/*": "./templates/*",
    "#components/*": "./templates/components/*"
  }
}
```

```js
//templates/components/MessageComponent.js
import html from '#html'

export default function MessageComponent(){
  return html`<h1> Message! </h1>
}
```

</v-click>

---

# HTML Rendering with HTM
I **LOVE** HTM!

<v-click>

```js
//templates/html.js
import htm from "htm";
import vhtml from "vhtml";
export const html = htm.bind(vhtml);
```

```js
export const UploadPage = (props = {}) =>
  html`
    <${BasePage}>
      <form
        x-data="{file: null, loading: false}"
        action="/upload"
        method="POST"
        enctype="multipart/form-data"
        @submit="loading=true"
      >
        <${FileUpload} name="file" />
        ${props.message && html`<p>${props.message}</p>`}
      </form>
    <//>
  `;

```

# Node streams
Node has its own streams and they dominate the node ecosystem.

<v-click>


```js
const writable = new Writable()
writable.pipe()
writable.write()
const readable = new Readable()
readable.pipe()
readable.read()
const duplex = new Duplex()
duplex.pipe()
duplex.write()
duplex.read()
```

</v-click>

---

# Using node streams

```js {1-8|9-13|14-20|21-23|all}
await ensureDir("./uploads"); //ensureX functions are from `fs-extra`
await ensureFile("./uploads/report.tar.gz");
const fileWritableStream = Writable.toWeb( //You can convert node streams to Web Streams
  createWriteStream("./uploads/report.tar.gz", { //a WriteStream implements a Writable
    flags: "w",
  })
);
await file.stream().pipeTo(fileWritableStream) //our file is written and saved
const uploadedFileReadStream = createReadStream("./uploads/report.tar.gz", { //a ReadStream implements a Readable
  flags: "r",
});
const untar = extract(); //from the `tar-stream` package. Writable
const gunzip = createGunzip(); //from `node:zlib`. Transform stream!
untar.on("entry", async function (header, stream, next) {
  stream.on("end", () => next());
  const filePath = header.name;
  await ensureFile("./extracted/" + filePath);
  await writeFile("./extracted/" + filePath, stream);
  stream.end();
});
uploadedFileReadStream.pipe(gunzip).pipe(untar);
await finished(uploadedFileReadStream); //from node:stream/promises
return ctx.html(UploadPage({ message: "Upload successful!" }));
```

# Node frustrations
- Callbacks are still fairly common, less async/await syntax
- Node streams are more complex than web streams
- CommonJS is still very common and makes writing ESM code frustrating

## Deno

Lower peak memory usage
- peaked around 190ish MB

Fewer 3rd party dependencies
- hono
- preact (or htm)
- preact-render-to-string (or vhtml)

## Node

Higher peak memory usage
- peaked around 210ish MB

More 3rd party dependencies
- hono
- htm
- vhtml
- fs-extra
- tar-stream

Memory usage is probably pretty close, this was just measuring on Fly.io

Hono has to be doing something weird here...
